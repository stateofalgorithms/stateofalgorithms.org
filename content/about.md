**State of Algorithms** is a project dedicated to providing clear, evidence-based analysis of the artificial intelligence landscape.

Our goal is to cut through the noise of both the hype and the doom narratives. We believe the reality of AI's impact lies somewhere in the middle, and we're here to investigate it.

### Our Methodology
We are committed to:
- Citing primary sources
- Transparent fact-checking
- Clearly distinguishing between peer-reviewed findings and expert opinion
