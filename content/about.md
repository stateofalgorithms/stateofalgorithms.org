**State of Algorithms is an independent platform that is neither pro-AI nor anti-AI; our position is simply pro-evidence.**

Our mission is to make the public debate about artificial intelligence sharper, fairer, and more factual. We cut through both the hype and the doom-mongering by challenging claims and verifying facts, so that critical decisions can be based on data, not narrative.

While AI is a global phenomenon, our initial focus is on the European landscape, guided by our perspective as founders based in Germany and The Netherlands.

We operate under a set of public [Editorial Principles](/editorial-principles/) and a transparent [Governance Framework](/governance/). Our project is entirely volunteer-run and does not accept funding, a structure that guarantees our independence.
