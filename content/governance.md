## Editorial Structure

### Current Phase: Founding Editors (Verified Pseudonymity)
State of Algorithms is currently guided by a small group of founding editors based in Germany and The Netherlands. We operate under a model of verified pseudonymity to achieve two distinct goals:

1. **To Protect our Contributors:** This model shields our team from the bad-faith harassment and professional risks that can stifle the nuanced discourse we aim to foster. It is a defense against personal attacks, not intellectual scrutiny.

2. **To Focus on Substance:** Our content quality is not ensured by our identities, but by our public and rigorous [Editorial Principles](/editorial-principles/), our commitment to evidence, and our open invitation for community feedback and criticism.

### Identity Verification
In our founding phase, our editors have internally verified each other's credentials and lack of major conflicts of interest. We are fully committed to securing this verification from a trusted, independent third party as a top priority once the platform is established. We will be transparent throughout this process.

### Funding and Independence
**State of Algorithms is, by design, an unfunded and volunteer-run project. We will not accept funding of any kind, from any source.** This non-commercial structure is a core principle that guarantees our absolute independence and allows us to focus solely on our evidence-based mission without external influence or financial pressure.

## Decision-Making Process

### Editorial Decisions
Editorial decisions are made by the founding editors in alignment with our stated principles. Our process emphasizes providing clear, reasoned feedback for all submissions. A public-facing decision log is a goal for a future phase of our evolution, as outlined in the roadmap.

### Community Input
Community input is vital to our mission. While more structured mechanisms like formal surveys are a long-term goal, we are committed to engaging with our community from day one. We maintain a standing invitation for response pieces to any published content and welcome all feedback through our public contact channels.

## Evolution Timeline

### 6-Month Review
- Assessment of community growth and engagement
- Evaluation of editorial decision patterns
- Community feedback on governance effectiveness

### 12-18 Month Transition
- Recruitment of co-editors with public identities
- Implementation of collective decision-making
- Gradual reduction of founding editors' authority

### Long-term Vision
- Community-elected editorial board
- Fully distributed governance model
- Institutional independence from any individual

## Accountability Mechanisms

### Community Oversight
- Public appeals process for editorial decisions
- Community veto power over major governance changes
- Ombudsperson role for complaints and disputes
- Transparent resignation protocols if principles are violated

### Red Lines
- Never claim neutrality, only transparency about our perspective
- Never dismiss concerns without substantive engagement
- Never platform known bad-faith actors regardless of "balance"
- Never allow funding sources to influence editorial direction

## Amendment Process
This governance framework can be amended through:
1. Public proposal and 30-day comment period
2. Community feedback integration
3. Final decision with published reasoning
4. 60-day implementation timeline
