## Core Philosophy

### Evidence Over Speculation
Our conclusions are driven by verifiable data, but we explicitly acknowledge the limits of evidence-based analysis. Many important questions about AI involve values, ethics, and uncertain predictions that can't be resolved through data alone.

### Intellectual Humility
- We admit when we don't know something
- We correct errors promptly and transparently
- We acknowledge competing interpretations of evidence
- We distinguish between confidence levels in our claims

## Our Perspective and Its Limitations

We do not claim a purely objective "view from nowhere." That is an impossible standard. Our commitment is not to an abstract neutrality, but to **transparency about our own perspective and methodology.**

Our analysis is guided by:
- **A Sociotechnical View:** We believe AI cannot be understood through technical metrics alone, but must be analyzed in its social, economic, and political context.
- **A European Regulatory Lens:** Our initial focus is grounded in the EU's approach to rights-based technology regulation.
- **An Acknowledgment of Values:** We recognize that interpreting evidence involves value judgments. Our core value is ensuring that technological progress does not come at the cost of public accountability and individual rights.

## Content Standards

### What We Cover
- **Explainers:** Foundational concepts that shape AI discourse
- **Investigations:** Claims that can be fact-checked or analyzed with available evidence
- **Analysis:** Current events with broader implications for AI policy and society
- **Response pieces:** Counter-arguments and alternative perspectives to our published content

### What We Don't Cover
- Pure opinion pieces without evidence base
- Breaking news without sufficient context
- Technical tutorials (plenty of good resources exist)
- Content primarily aimed at AI researchers (not our audience)

## Evidence Standards

### Source Hierarchy
1. **Primary sources:** Research papers, official documents, first-hand accounts
2. **Expert analysis:** Credentialed specialists commenting within their expertise
3. **Quality journalism:** Well-sourced reporting from established outlets
4. **Industry sources:** Vendor claims, marketing materials (treated skeptically)
5. **Social media:** Only for documenting public statements, never as evidence

### Verification Process
- All major factual claims must have citations
- Numerical data verified from original sources when possible
- Expert quotes confirmed directly when feasible
- Correction policy: errors fixed within 24 hours with prominent notation

## Bias Management

### Bias Mitigation Strategies
- **Devil's advocate requirement:** Every major piece must seriously engage with strongest counter-arguments
- **Perspective diversity:** Actively seek contributors from affected communities
- **Red team reviews:** Major investigations reviewed by subject matter experts who disagree with conclusions
- **Community feedback:** Public comment periods for controversial analyses

## Handling Uncertainty

### Confidence Levels
We explicitly label our confidence in major claims:
- **High confidence:** Multiple independent sources, peer review, established consensus
- **Medium confidence:** Good evidence but some gaps or disagreement among experts
- **Low confidence:** Limited evidence, early-stage research, or significant expert disagreement
- **Speculation:** Clearly labeled when we venture beyond available evidence

### "What We Don't Know" Sections
Every major investigation includes acknowledgment of:
- Key data that's unavailable or unreliable
- Important perspectives we may have missed
- Assumptions we're making that might be wrong
- Questions our analysis can't answer

## Controversial Topics

### Balanced Coverage Doesn't Mean False Balance
- We don't give equal weight to all viewpoints regardless of evidence
- We distinguish between legitimate scientific disagreement and fringe positions
- We provide context for minority positions (why they're minority positions)

### Engaging with Criticism
- We welcome substantive criticism and publish response pieces
- We distinguish between good-faith criticism and bad-faith attacks
- We don't platform known bad actors regardless of "balance"
- We engage seriously with criticism even when we disagree

## Ethical Guidelines

### Harm Reduction
- We consider potential harms from our coverage, especially to vulnerable communities
- We don't amplify dangerous misinformation even when fact-checking it
- We provide context that helps readers make informed decisions
- We avoid sensationalism that might distort public understanding
