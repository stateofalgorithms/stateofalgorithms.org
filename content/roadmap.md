- **Capture attempts:** Our no-funding policy, independence safeguards
- **Quality dilution:** Maintain editorial standards during scaling

### Phase 3 Risks
- **Institutional ossification:** Built-in renewal mechanisms
- **Political polarization:** Commitment to evidence-based analysis
- **Volunteer Sustainability:** Rotation of duties, clear succession planning, prevention of founder burnout
