# Editorial Principles

## Core Philosophy

### Evidence Over Speculation
Our conclusions are driven by verifiable data, but we explicitly acknowledge that evidence-based analysis has limits. Many important AI questions involve values, ethics, and uncertain predictions that can't be resolved through data alone.

### Intellectual Humility
- We admit when we don't know something
- We correct errors promptly and transparently
- We acknowledge competing interpretations of evidence
- We distinguish between our confidence levels in different claims

## Content Standards

### What We Cover
- **Explainers:** Foundational concepts that shape AI discourse
- **Investigations:** Claims that can be fact-checked or analyzed with available evidence
- **Analysis:** Current events with broader implications for AI policy and society
- **Response pieces:** Counter-arguments and alternative perspectives on any topic we've covered

### What We Don't Cover
- Pure opinion pieces without evidence base
- Breaking news without sufficient analysis time
- Technical tutorials aimed at practitioners
- Content primarily valuable only to AI researchers

## Evidence Standards

### Source Quality Hierarchy
1. **Primary sources:** Research papers, official documents, first-hand accounts
2. **Expert analysis:** Credentialed specialists commenting within their expertise
3. **Quality journalism:** Well-sourced reporting from established outlets
4. **Industry sources:** Vendor claims, marketing materials (treated with appropriate skepticism)
5. **Social media:** Only for documenting public statements, never as evidence for factual claims

### Our Verification Process
- All major factual claims must have citations to verifiable sources
- Numerical data traced back to original sources when possible
- Expert quotes confirmed with original speakers when feasible
- Corrections made within 24 hours with prominent acknowledgment

## Managing Our Perspective

### What We Bring to Analysis
We don't claim neutrality but commit to transparency about our perspective:
- **Evidence-focused but values-aware:** We acknowledge that interpreting evidence involves value judgments
- **Tech-informed but society-centered:** We understand technical concepts but prioritize societal implications  
- **Independent but not isolated:** We maintain independence while actively seeking diverse viewpoints

### How We Handle Bias
- **Seek disconfirming evidence:** We actively look for information that challenges our initial conclusions
- **Engage strongest counter-arguments:** Every major piece must seriously address the best opposing views
- **Diversify our sources:** We proactively seek contributors and experts from different backgrounds
- **Welcome criticism:** We publish thoughtful response pieces that disagree with our analysis

## Handling Uncertainty

### Confidence Levels
We explicitly indicate our confidence in major claims:
- **High confidence:** Multiple independent sources, established expert consensus, peer-reviewed evidence
- **Medium confidence:** Good evidence with some gaps or reasonable expert disagreement
- **Low confidence:** Limited evidence, early research, or significant expert disagreement  
- **Speculation:** Clearly labeled when we venture beyond available evidence for important questions

### "What We Don't Know" Requirements
Every investigation includes honest acknowledgment of:
- Key data that's unavailable, unreliable, or contested
- Important perspectives we may have missed or inadequately represented
- Assumptions we're making that might be wrong
- Questions our analysis can't definitively answer

## Controversial Topics

### Our Approach to Balance
- We provide proportional attention based on evidence quality, not just viewpoint diversity
- We distinguish between legitimate scientific disagreement and fringe positions
- We explain why minority positions are minority positions while still engaging with them fairly
- We don't give equal platforms to good-faith and bad-faith actors

### Community Engagement Standards
- We welcome substantive criticism and regularly publish response pieces
- We distinguish between constructive criticism and personal attacks
- We engage seriously with good-faith criticism even when we disagree with conclusions
- We maintain community guidelines focused on substance over tone

## Quality Assurance

### Editorial Review Process
1. **Fact-checking:** Verification of claims and source quality
2. **Clarity review:** Accessibility for educated non-expert readers  
3. **Perspective check:** Consideration of alternative interpretations and missing viewpoints
4. **Impact assessment:** Potential consequences and misinterpretations of our analysis

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular review of past analyses for accuracy over time
- Community feedback integration for identifying blind spots
- Transparent acknowledgment when our predictions or analyses prove incorrect
- Evolution of our methods based on lessons learned

## Ethical Commitments

### Harm Consideration
- We consider potential negative consequences of our coverage, especially for vulnerable communities
- We provide sufficient context to prevent misinterpretation or misuse
- We don't amplify dangerous misinformation even when criticizing it
- We avoid sensationalism that might distort public understanding

### Transparency Requirements
- We acknowledge the limitations of our expertise and analysis
- We distinguish between empirical questions and value judgments
- We're explicit about our methodology and potential blind spots
- We don't oversell the certainty or implications of our conclusions

## Community Accountability

### Our Commitments
- Respectful engagement with all contributors regardless of agreement level
- Transparent reasoning for editorial decisions
- Responsive correction of errors and acknowledgment of valid criticism
- Regular assessment of whether we're meeting our stated principles

### How to Hold Us Accountable
- Public feedback via comments, email, or social media
- Formal appeals process for editorial decisions
- Community input on major changes to editorial direction
- Regular surveys on whether we're fulfilling our mission
