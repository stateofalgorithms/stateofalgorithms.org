## Resource Constraints & Adaptations

### Working Within Our Limits
- **Time:** All editors volunteer part-time, so growth must be sustainable
- **Expertise:** We actively seek contributors to fill our knowledge gaps
- **Reach:** We focus on quality over quantity to build reputation organically
- **Technology:** We keep technical infrastructure simple and maintainable

### Adaptation Triggers
This roadmap adapts based on:
- Community response and growth patterns
- Availability of quality contributors
- Changes in AI discourse landscape
- Founding editors' capacity and life circumstances

## Risk Management

### Phase 1 Risks
- **Burnout:** Sustainable pace, shared workload from the start
- **Quality:** Over-invest in editorial rigor, under-promise on quantity
- **Irrelevance:** Focus on timeless principles, not just current news

### Phase 2 Risks
- **Mission drift:** Regular check-ins on adherence to principles
- **Overwhelm:** Scale contributors before scaling content commitments
- **Co-optation:** Maintain independence through transparency and community accountability

### Phase 3 Risks
- **Institutional capture:** Community oversight and leadership rotation
- **Stagnation:** Built-in renewal and evolution mechanisms
- **Founder dependence:** Early investment in knowledge transfer and succession
