# State of Algorithms

An independent platform dedicated to making the public debate about artificial intelligence (AI) sharper, fairer, and more factual.

## Mission

State of Algorithms is an independent platform that is neither pro-AI nor anti-AI; **our position is simply pro-evidence.** We are dedicated to making the public debate about artificial intelligence sharper and more factual by cutting through both hype and doom-mongering. We challenge claims and verify facts so that decisions can be based on data, not narrative.

## What You'll Find Here

* **Explainers**: Clear, concise articles that demystify complex AI terms and concepts.
* **Investigations**: In-depth research into claims from vendors, policy proposals, and new AI trends.
* **Posts**: Timely, evidence-based analysis of current events in the AI landscape.

## Who We Are

State of Algorithms is a lean, independent editorial collective founded by three researchers committed to evidence-based AI analysis. Our small size ensures every piece gets careful attention and direct editor involvement, while our independence means we answer only to evidence and our community.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from diverse perspectives to help make AI discourse more evidence-based and inclusive. Whether you're a technical expert, policy researcher, affected community member, or informed observer, we want to hear from you.

**How to submit:**
- **GitHub:** Fork this repository, add your article as Markdown in `/content/[type]/`, and submit a Pull Request
- **Email:** Send your draft to contact@stateofalgorithms.org - we work closely with all contributors to strengthen their pieces

We review all submissions for factual accuracy, clarity, and alignment with our principles. See our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Our Principles

* **Evidence Over Speculation**: Our conclusions are driven by verifiable data, not narrative or conjecture.
* **Intellectual Humility**: If we get it wrong, we admit it and correct the record promptly and transparently.
* **Open to Scrutiny**: We welcome criticism and engage with feedback to improve our work.
* **Vendor-Agnostic**: Our analysis is independent and free from commercial interests.
* **Politically Independent**: Our work is non-partisan and free from political ideology or influence.
* **Accessible**: Our content is technically accurate but written to be understood by non-experts.
* **Action-Oriented**: Every article provides concrete insights and takeaways.

## Our Approach

We're committed to transparent, accountable editorial practices. Our [Editorial Principles](EDITORIAL_PRINCIPLES.md) detail our content standards and how we handle bias and uncertainty. Our [Governance Framework](GOVERNANCE.md) explains our decision-making process and how we plan to evolve as our community grows.

## Funding & Independence

**State of Algorithms is an unfunded, volunteer-run project.** This ensures our complete independence from any commercial or political influence, allowing us to focus solely on evidence-based analysis.
